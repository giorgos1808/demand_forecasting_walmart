# Demand Forecasting Walmart

Greetings from our repository, where we unveil our project dedicated to forecasting retail store sales.

Our journey commenced with a meticulous analysis and processing of data, ensuring its readiness for input into machine learning models. Subsequently, we delved into the application of diverse machine learning models, fine-tuning their hyperparameters to unearth the optimal fits.

The model training and validation processes unfolded twice—first, incorporating features describing promotions, and second, without—allowing us to dissect the impact of promotions on model performance.

Contained within this repository are all the essential components: code snippets, documentation, and datasets pivotal to our project. A comprehensive report detailing our methodology and unveiling key findings is also at your disposal.

Our vision for this project is to offer invaluable insights for retail stores seeking enhancements in sales forecasting. We extend an invitation to explore our repository and witness firsthand how the power of machine learning can transform real-world business challenges. Happy exploring!
